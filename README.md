# UE5 Horror Mechanics

### This Project was a sample project suggested by Mindera during an interview process, since there was no NDA or any other requirement to keep it a secret, I made it public for portfolio propouses.


  
 #### This project has no more than 8 hours of work divided in 4 days.


- The core mechanics were a First Person moving around the scene trying to avoid being touched by the enemies.
- The enemies can only move when the player is not looking at it.
- During the play, a new enemy enters the scene and follows the player.
- The focus of this project is on game mechanics. The scene and the UI were just informative.
